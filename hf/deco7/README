sim.fid 
 Simulated 3D CBCANH time-domain data. 
 Decompose with "basis_fid/*.fid"

sim.ft1
 Data "sim.fid" processed in the X-axis (direct dimension).
 Decompose with "basis_ft1/*.ft1"

sim.ft2
 Data "sim.fid" processed in the X and Y axis.
 Decompose with "basis/*.ft2"

sim.ft3
 Data "sim.fid" fully processed in X, Y, and Z.
 Decompose with "basis/*.ft2"

mask.fid
  Non-uniform sampling (NUS) mask of 0 and 1, 25% sampling density.

sim_nus.fid
  Data "sim.fid" with all but 25% set to zero according to "mask.fid".
  Decompose with "basis_fid/*.fid" 
  *** Does the decomposition reproduce the missing data well?

sim_nus.ft1
  Data "sim_nus.fid" processed in the X-axis.
  Decompose with "basis_ft1/*.ft1"

mask.ft1
  NUS mask corresponding to "sim_nus.ft1"

sim_inv.fid
  Data "sim.ft1" inverse processed in X-axis to time-domain.
  Decompose with "basis_inv/*.fid"

sim_inv_baseline.fid
  Data "sim_inv.fid" with first 5 points of every row set to zero (baseline distortion).
  Decompose with "basis_inv/*.fid"
  *** Does the decomposition reproduce the missing 5 points well?
 
mask_inv_baseline.fid
  NUS mask corresponding to "sim_inv_baseline.fid" (that is, all 1 but the first 5 points).
